# 🔗 Graph Theory Project – C++ Implementation
This repository contains three separate C++ programs developed as part of the **Graph Theory course (Teoria dos Grafos)**. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of graph theory, implemented using foundational algorithms and data structures relevant to the subject.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 Trabalho 1:

**File**: [`TeoGraf_Trab01.cpp`](https://github.com/LuizGAPires/TeoGraf_2022.2/blob/main/Trabalho%201/TeoGraf_Trab01.cpp)

This project implements the foundational components of graphs:
- Representation of **undirected** graphs using adjacency lists and adjacency matrix
- Insertion and removal of vertices and edges
- DFS and BFS traversals
- Degree calculation and connectivity checks

Key Concepts:  
➡️ Graph representation, Traversal algorithms (DFS/BFS), Graph manipulation

### 🔹 Trabalho 2:

**File**: [`TeoGraf_Trab02.cpp`](https://github.com/LuizGAPires/TeoGraf_2022.2/blob/main/Trabalho%202/TeoGraf_Trab02.cpp)

This project builds upon the fundamentals and focuses on:
- Representation of **directed** graphs
- Implementation of **Prim Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithm
- Implementation of **Dijkstra's algorithm**

Key Concepts:  
➡️ Graph representation, MST, Dijkstra algorithm

### 🔹 Trabalho 3:

**File**: [`TeoGraf_Trab03.cpp`](https://github.com/LuizGAPires/TeoGraf_2022.2/blob/main/Trabalho_3/TeoGraf_Trab03.cpp)

This project implements **maximum flow** computation using the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** based on:
- Capacity-constrained directed graphs
- Residual graphs and augmenting paths
- Use of Breadth-first Search to find paths with available capacity

Key Concepts:  
🔁 Ford-Fulkerson, Residual graphs, Flow networks, Augmenting paths
